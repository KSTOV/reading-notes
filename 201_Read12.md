## Canvas API

### Basic Usage

- The `<canvas>` element has only two attributes, width and height
- Can be styled just like any normal image
- The `<canvas>` element requires the closing tag `</canvas>`
- Creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, used to create and manipulate the content shown

### Drawing Shapes with Canvas

- `<canvas>` only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths
-  A path is a list of points connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved, 
   of different width and of different color
- A path, or even a subpath, can be closed


### Applying Styles and colors

- To apply colors to a shape use `fillstyle` and `strokestyle`
- `fillstyle` sets the style when filling shapes
- `strokestyle` sets the style for shapes outlines
- Color is a string representing a CSS `<color>`, a gradient object, or a pattern object

### Drawing Text

- `filltext` fills a given text at the given (x,y) position
- `stroketext` strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position
