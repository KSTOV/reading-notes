# Classes & Objects / Thinking Recursively

## Classes and Objects

- Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity
- Objects get their variables and functions from classes
- Classes are essentially a template to create your objects

Example of a class from: [Reference](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)

```Python
    class MyClass:
        variable = "blah"

        def function(self):
            print("This is a message inside the class.")
```

- To assign class to object: myobjectx = MyClass()
- To access the varible inside object: myobjectx.variable
- To access a function inside of an object: myobjectx.function()
- You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class
- The __init__() function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated

## Think Recursively

- A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions
- All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case

Example from: [Reference](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)

````Python
def factorial_recursive(n):
    # Base case: 1! = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1)
````

- To maintain state during recursion you have to either:
    - Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context
    - Keep the state in global scope
- A data structure is recursive if it can be deﬁned in terms of a smaller version of itself
- Recursive data structures and recursive functions go together

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

- In pytest, you define fixtures using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator, along with a function definition
- "code coverage" checks that your tests have run all of the code
- pytest-cov on PyPI
- you can invoke pytest with the --cov
