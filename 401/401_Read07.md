## Python Scope

- The scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can access that name, such as variables, functions, objects
- Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code
- Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope
- Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions.
- Built-in scope contains names such as keywords, functions, exceptions, and other attributes
- Global statement can define a list of names that are going to be treated as global names
- Nonlocal statement an define a list of names that are going to be treated as nonlocal
