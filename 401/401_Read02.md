# Testing and Modules

## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

- Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code
- Tests can be considered as your alive documentation
- Be descriptive about it and to say what is expected and what we are testing
- Test file name should follow the same name of module name
- A convention widely used is the AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert
    - Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
    - Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
    - Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.
- TDD: the cycle is made by 3 steps
    - Write a unit test and make it fail
    - Write the feature and make the test pass
    - Refactor the code
- The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the software design first
- Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests

## If name equals main

- Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables
- If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”
- A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements
- If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
- Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
- If __name__ == “main”: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

## Recursion

- Recursion is the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly
- The corresponding function is called as recursive function
- The solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems
- A function fun is called direct recursive if it calls the same function fun
- A function fun is called indirect recursive if it calls another function say fun_new and fun_new calls fun directly or indirectly
- A recursive function is tail recursive when recursive call is the last thing executed by the function
- When any function is called from main(), the memory is allocated to it on the stack
- A recursive function calls itself, the memory for a called function is allocated on top of memory allocated to calling function and different copy of local variables is created for each function call
- Recursion provides a clean and simple way to write code
