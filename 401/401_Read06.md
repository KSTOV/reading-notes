## How to use Random Module

- The random module provides access to functions that support many operations
- Most importantly it allows you to generate random numbers
- The Random module contains:
    - .randint()
    - .random()
    - .choice()
    - .shuffle()
    - .randrange()

## What is Risk Analysis

- Risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test
- Risks that are unavoidable:
    - The time that you allocated for testing
    - A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application
    - Urgency from the clients to deliver the project
    - Incomplete requirements
- Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting
- Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas
- Create a Risk Assessment database for future use
- Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, medium, low.
- Risk magnitude indicators:
    - High: means the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable.
    - Medium: it is tolerable but not desirable
    - Low: it is tolerable
- Risk Identification:
    - Business Risks: The risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.
    - Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.
    - Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required
    - Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.
- The perspective of Risk Assessment
    - Effect
    - Cause
    - Likelihood

## Test Coverage

- Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase
- You are doing enough testing if:
    - You rarely get bugs that escape into production
    - You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs
- Coverage analysis helps you find which bits of your code aren't being tested
