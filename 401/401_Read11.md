# Data Analysis

## What is Jupyter Lab

- JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter
- JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner
- You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters
- Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output
- Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel
- Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel
- JupyterLab extensions can customize or enhance any part of JupyterLab, including new themes, file editors, and custom components

## NumPy

- Commonly used Python data analysis package
- Can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem
- NumPy works with multidimensional arrays
- Create a NumPy array using the `numpy.array` function
- `numpy.genfromtxt` function to read csv or other files into arrays
