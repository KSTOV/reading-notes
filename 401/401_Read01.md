## Pain and suffering

- Throughout the next 10 weeks I will be put through a lot of pain (growth) and will be pushed mentally and emotionally having to figure out how to collaborate with new people and get out of my confort zone.

## Beginners Guide to Big O

- Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm
- O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set
- O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set
- O(NÂ²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set
- O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set
