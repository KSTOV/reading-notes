## Decisions and Loops

- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next
- Comparison operators `(===, !==, ==, !=, <,>,<=,=>)`
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators
- if...else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true and another is false
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes 
  and also provide a default option if none match
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another
- 3 types of loops: each repeats a set of statements
    - for
    - while
    - do...while
