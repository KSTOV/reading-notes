## Functions

- One of the fundamental building blocks in Javascript

- A function statement consists of the function keyword followed by:
    - Name of the Function
    - List of Parameters
    - Javascript statement

- Defining a function does not execute it

### Function Scope

- Varibles defined in the function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function

- Functions can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined.

### Control Flow

- Order in which the computer executes statements and scripts
