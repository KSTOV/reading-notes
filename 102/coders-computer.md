## Choosing a Text Editor

- The different classifications are Text Editors and IDEs

- Text Editors just edit text and IDEs have:
  - File Manager
  - Compiler
  - Debugger

- Its important to be thoughtful about the one you choose because of the features that come with them like:
  - Code Completion
  - Syntax Highlighting
  - Extensions
  - Themes
 
 
 ## The Command Line
 
 Allows us to type commands like:
  - ls = "List"
  - cd = "Change Directory"
  - pwd = "Print Working Directory"
  - mkdir = "Make Directory"
  - cp = "Copy"
  - rm = "Remove"
  - mv = "Move"


## Basic Navigation

2 types of paths **Absolute** and **Relative**
Absolute paths begin with "/" and show location in root directory
- ex: /home/username/files

Relative paths show where we currently are and no "/" in the beginning
- ex: ls files

- ~ = shortcut to home directory
- . = current directory
- .. = parent directory

## About Files

- file = type of file or directory
- ls -a = list with hidden files
