## Expressions and Operators

- Javascript has the following operators
    - Assignment

    - Comparison
        - (==) compares operands and returns
    - Arithmetic
        - (+,-,*,/, %)

# Loops

- Loops offer a quick and easy way to do things repeatedly

- Repeat an action some numbers of times

- The statements for loops are:
    - for
        - repeats until a specific condition evaluates to false
    - do...while
        - repeats until a specific condition evaluates to false
    - while
        - executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true
    - labeled
        - provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program
    - break
        - terminate a loop
    - continue
        - used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement
    - for...in
        - terates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object
    - for...of
        - creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects including Array, Map, Set, arguments
