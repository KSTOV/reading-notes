# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

### Who is Roy Fielding?

- He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

### Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- They weren't designed to be used like that

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- HTTP

### What does a GET do?

- Requests a representation of the specified resource

### What does a POST do?

- Sends data to the server

### What does PUT do?

- Creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload

### What does PATCH do?

- Applies partial modifications to a resource
