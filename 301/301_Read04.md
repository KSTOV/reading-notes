# React and Forms

## React Docs - Forms

### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- A component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state

### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- Update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them since `handleChange` runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types

### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- event.target.type

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

### Why would we use a ternary operator?

- To write an if statement in a single line

### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```` Javascript
if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
} else {
 console.log(false);
}
````

````Javascript
x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
````
