# State and Props


## React lifecycle

### Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

- `render` happens first

### What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

- `constructor`

### Put the following things in the order that they happen: `componentDidMount`, `render`, `constructor`, `componentWillUnmount`, `React Updates`

1. `constructor`
2. `render`
3. `React Updates`
4. `componentDidMount`
5. `componentWillUnmount`

### What does componentDidMount do?

- This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().


## React State Vs Props

### What types of things can you pass in the props?

- any data type

### What is the big difference between props and state?

- Props you pass into a component and outside the component
- State is handled inside the component

### When do we re-render our application?

- when a component's state or props has changed

### What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

- The state is encapsulated data where you store assets that are persistent between component renderings.
