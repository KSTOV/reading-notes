## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

### What is a ‘call’?

- Primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous

### How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

- One at a time

### What does LIFO mean?

- Last In First Out

### Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

Example from freecodecamp.org
````Javascript
function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
````

### What causes a Stack Overflow?

- A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function without an exit point

## JavaScript error messages

### What is a ‘refrence error’?

- when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared

### What is a ‘syntax error’?

- occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax

### What is a ‘range error’?

- manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length

### What is a ‘type error’?

- when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible

### What is a breakpoint?

- a point in the program where the code will stop executing

### What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

- debugs your code for specific values
