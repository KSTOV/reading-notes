## React Docs - list and keys

## The Spread Operator

### What is the spread operator?

- A useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments

### List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

- Copying an Array, Using Math Functions, Adding an item to a list, Combining objects

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

<!-- Example from: https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab -->

````Javascript
const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
````

### Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

<!-- Example from: https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab -->

````Javascript
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]
````

### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

<!-- Example from: https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab -->

````Javascript
[...["😋😛😜🤪😝"]] // Array [ "😋😛😜🤪😝" ]
[..."🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!"] // Array(9) [ "🙂", "🙃", "😉", "😊", "😇", "🥰", "😍", "🤩", "!" ]

const hello = {hello: "😋😛😜🤪😝"}
const world = {world: "🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!"}

const helloWorld = {...hello,...world}
console.log(helloWorld) // Object { hello: "😋😛😜🤪😝", world: "🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!" }
````

### In your own words, what does the `increment` function do?

- recieves a name and search through the array and increment the matching name

### How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

- inside the parent render(): method={this.method} the same as a prop

### How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
