- An article about how Google did a study on Pyschological Safety and how to improve their teams and work environment
- Google started Project Aristotle and "After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, 
  Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams"
- " Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency."
