## What is CSS

- Stands for Cascading Style Sheets

- CSS syntax opens with a selector that selects the HTML element you want to style, then a set of { }

- Inside the { } will be declarations: property and value

- Property before colon and value after
    ' h1 {
          color: red;
          font-size: 5em;
     } '
