# JS Debugging

## Error Handling & Debugging

- If you understand execution contexts and stacks you are more likely to find th error in your code
- Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction
- The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located so you try to find the exact error
- JS has 7 different tyoes if errors. Each creates its own error object which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error
- If you know that you may get an error you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements
