# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Links

- Links are created using `<a>` element
- The `<a>` element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to
- If you are linking to a page within your own site it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to

## Layout

- `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid layouts
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page

## Functions, Methods & Objects

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task
- Functions can take parameters and may return a value
- If you declare a variable within a function it can only be used within that function
- Global variables use more memory
