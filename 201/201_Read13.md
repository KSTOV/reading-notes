## HTML5 Storage

- Is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser
- The data persists even after you navigate away from the web site
- This data is never transmitted to the remote web server
- Based on named key/value pairs
- The storage event is fired on the window object whenever `setItem()`, `removeItem()`, or `clear()` is called
- The storage event is supported everywhere the localStorage object is supported
- Data is stored as strings
