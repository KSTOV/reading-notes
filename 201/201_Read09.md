# Forms and JS Events

## [Table of Contents](README.md)

## Forms

- Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a `<form>` element
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs
- Each form control is given a name and the text the users types in or values of the options they select are sent to the server
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill on forms

## Lists, Tables & Forms

- List markers can be given different appearances using the `list-style-type` and `list-style` image properties
- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistant
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS
- Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive

## Events

- Events are the browsers way to indicating when something has happened
- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon
- When an event occurs on an element it can trigger a JS function. 
  When this function then changes the web page in some way it feels interactive because it has responded to the user
- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children if an element
