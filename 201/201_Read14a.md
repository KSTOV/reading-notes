# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## [Table of Contents](README.md)

## CSS Transforms

- The `transform` property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional
- Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane
- Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes
- Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis
- Three-dimensional transforms help define the length and width of an element, but also the depth
- The `rotate` value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees
- Using the `scale` value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element
- It is possible to scale only the height or width of an element using the `scaleX` and `scaleY` values
- The `translate` value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions
- `Skew` is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both

## CSS Transitions & Animations

- There are four transition related properties in total:
    - `transition-property`
        - Determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties
        - If multiple properties need to be transitioned they may be comma separated within the transition-property 
    - `transition-duration`
        - The duration in which a transition takes place
        - The value of this property can be set using general timing values, including seconds and milliseconds
    - `transition-timing-function`
        - Used to set the speed in which a transition will move
        - Popular keyword values for the `transition-timing-function` property include `linear`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, and `ease-in-out`
        - Each timing function has a `cubic-bezier` curve behind it
    - `transition-delay`
        - Sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds, that determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing
- To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the `@keyframes` rule
- The `@keyframes` rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated
- The `animation-name` property is used with the animation name
- To start, animations need a duration declared using the `animation-duration` property
- To have an animation repeat itself numerous times the `animation-iteration-count` property may be used
- To declare the direction an animation completes use the `animation-direction` property
- The `animation-play-state` property allows an animation to be played or paused using the `running` and `paused` keywords
- The `animation-fill-mode` property identifies how an element should be styled before, after, or before and after an animation is run
